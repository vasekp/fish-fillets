dialogId("kuf-v-noco", "font_big", "You know there’s nothing we can do about it.")

dialogId("kuf-v-hod", "font_big", "Let’s push it down so we can take a look at it.")

dialogId("kuf-v-doprace", "font_big", "Well, let’s get to work.")

dialogId("kuf-v-dotoho", "font_big", "So, now we can finally get started.")

dialogId("kuf-m-ven", "font_small", "Our first task is to get out of this room.")

dialogId("kuf-v-ukol", "font_big", "This, by the way, is going to be our task in all the other rooms as well.")

dialogId("kuf-v-jeste", "font_big", "Should we watch it again?")

dialogId("kuf-m-disk", "font_small", "How? The disk self-destructed.")

dialogId("kuf-v-restart", "font_big", "We could restart the level.")

dialogId("kuf-m-pravda", "font_small", "That’s true...")

dialogId("kuf-m-dodilny", "font_small", "Come on, let’s take the player into the workshop and show him the work safety regulations.")

dialogId("kuf-v-napad", "font_big", "Good idea.")

dialogId("kuf-m-nezvednu", "font_small", "I can’t lift it. Can you give it a try?")

dialogId("kuf-m-kousek", "font_small", "Just a little bit higher so I can swim underneath you.")

dialogId("help1", "font_small", "For now, don’t touch anything, just watch and learn. We’ll show you what you should and shouldn’t do with us as well as what things we’re capable of.")

dialogId("help2", "font_big", "Before entering the workshop, let’s save the game - just press the F2 key.")

dialogId("help3", "font_small", "First we’ll show you what can hurt us.")

dialogId("help4", "font_big", "I’ll volunteer to be the dummy.")

dialogId("help5", "font_small", "First of all, we shouldn’t drop things on each other.")

dialogId("help6", "font_small", "We also can’t swim downwards when carrying an object, because it would fall on us.")

dialogId("help7", "font_big", "Now we’ll start again - or we can load the saved game by pressing the F3 key.")

dialogId("help8", "font_big", "And now we’re back where we last saved the game.")

dialogId("help9", "font_small", "Another thing we must not do is push objects along our back.")

dialogId("help10", "font_small", "Some objects are shaped in such a way that we could hold them and push them at the same time - but we’re not allowed to do this either.")

dialogId("help11", "font_big", "Again, we load a saved game by pressing the F3 key.")

dialogId("help12", "font_small", "We also can’t drop additional objects on a pile that one of us is carrying.")

dialogId("help13", "font_small", "And unlike my bigger partner, I can’t move or even carry steel objects.")

dialogId("help14", "font_big", "We have loaded our saved game for the last time. Now we’ll show you all the things we’re capable of.")

dialogId("help15", "font_small", "We can always pick up objects and then let them fall.")

dialogId("help16", "font_small", "We can push an object along each other’s back only if the object will then be pushed onto another support...")

dialogId("help17", "font_small", "... and even let it drop on each other in this case.")

dialogId("help18", "font_small", "I can even do this alone... I can swim down under it... or put it on this ledge.")

dialogId("help19", "font_small", "We can also push one object along the top of another object which we are supporting, but we can’t move the object that is directly on our back.")

dialogId("help20", "font_big", "We can also swim freely under an object which we are supporting and pass it to the other fish.")

dialogId("help21", "font_small", "And we can push objects off of each other’s back, as long as the object falls down immediately.")

dialogId("help22", "font_big", "That’s about it for the rules. If you want to know more, press F1 and read the help section.")

dialogId("help23", "font_small", "In summary, we can only lift objects, let them drop, push them along a solid surface, push them onto a surface, and push them off of each other.")
