dialogId("rand-0-3", "font_big", "You think the lever has any impact on the magnets?")

dialogId("rand-0-4", "font_small", "At least it should be connected with the magnetic field right up.")

dialogId("rand-1-3", "font_big", "Then we should find it out. But in my opinion they are only here to be in our way.")

dialogId("rand-2-1", "font_big", "Where?")

dialogId("rand-2-2", "font_small", "Well, the small can down there.")

dialogId("rand-2-3-0", "font_big", "Perhaps it is still full.")

dialogId("rand-2-3-1", "font_big", "It is an artefact and not garbage.")

dialogId("rand-2-3-2", "font_big", "I don’t think it is really a can. It’s likely a cloaked alien control unit.")

dialogId("rand-6-3", "font_big", "As I said, it is an unidentified alien artefact.")

dialogId("rand-6-4", "font_small", "Yes. But what is its purpose?")

dialogId("rand-6-5", "font_big", "If I knew that, it wouldn’t be unidentified alien artefact anymore but only an alien artefact.")
