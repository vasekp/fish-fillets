dialogId("init-0-1", "font_big", "What did you say?")

dialogId("init-0-2", "font_small", "That someone has built a lock in the stone.")

dialogId("init-0-3", "font_big", "So you were talking nonsense. There is no lock in the stone.")

dialogId("init-0-4", "font_small", "In the previous level there was.")

dialogId("init-0-5", "font_big", "What does that matter in this level?")

dialogId("init-0-6", "font_small", "There are four locks and four keys here.")

dialogId("init-0-7", "font_big", "Aha.")

dialogId("rand-0-0", "font_small", "We are getting closer to the creator of the lock in the previous level.")

dialogId("rand-0-1", "font_big", "Oh? Where is he?")

dialogId("rand-0-2", "font_small", "I don’t know.")

dialogId("rand-0-3", "font_big", "Then how do you know that we are getting closer.")

dialogId("rand-0-4", "font_small", "Look around, what do you see?")

dialogId("rand-0-5-0", "font_big", "A brick wall.")

dialogId("rand-0-5-1", "font_big", "Steel.")

dialogId("rand-0-5-2", "font_big", "You.")

dialogId("rand-0-5-3", "font_big", "Water.")

dialogId("rand-0-5-4", "font_big", "An exit we cannot reach.")

dialogId("rand-0-5-5", "font_big", "Darkness. But only when my eyes are closed.")

dialogId("rand-0-6", "font_small", "What else?")

-- get another of the rand-0-5 which was not used jet.

dialogId("rand-0-7", "font_small", "I give up.")


dialogId("rand-1-0", "font_big", "Which of the keys might fit in the lock?")

dialogId("rand-1-1", "font_small", "All or none. They all look the same.")


dialogId("rand-2-0", "font_big", "At least the keys are not stuck in the ground.")


dialogId("rand-3-0", "font_small", "Why don’t you swim really hard into to the wall? It might collapse.")

dialogId("rand-3-1", "font_big", "Why don’t you look for a hole and take it apart from there?")

dialogId("rand-3-2", "font_small", "Maybe the player could modify this program so it would be possible?")

dialogId("rand-3-3-0", "font_big", "That would be cheating.")

dialogId("rand-3-3-1", "font_big", "This would be boring.")

dialogId("rand-3-4-0", "font_small", "That’s true.")

dialogId("rand-3-4-1", "font_small", "But the level would be solved.")


dialogId("rand-4-0", "font_big", "Do you think these keys would have been useful in the previous level?")

dialogId("rand-4-1", "font_small", "Of course not.")

dialogId("rand-4-2", "font_big", "Why not?")

dialogId("rand-4-3", "font_small", "Think a little bit.")

dialogId("rand-4-4-0", "font_big", "Of course! We needed a key with three tines.")

dialogId("rand-4-4-1", "font_big", "Of course! On these keys the tines have unequal length.")

dialogId("rand-4-4-2", "font_big", "Of course! There are four keys here but there was only one lock there.")

dialogId("rand-4-5", "font_small", "No. The lock was much bigger.")

dialogId("rand-4-6", "font_big", "I see.")


dialogId("rand-5-0", "font_big", "If all the locks would vanish, we could leave more easily.")

dialogId("rand-5-1", "font_small", "That is the point of locks.")


dialogId("rand-6-0", "font_big", "We should take a key with us for a later level.")

dialogId("rand-6-1", "font_small", "Good idea.")


dialogId("rand-7-0", "font_big", "Why don’t we just unlock it?")

dialogId("rand-7-1", "font_small", "OK.")
