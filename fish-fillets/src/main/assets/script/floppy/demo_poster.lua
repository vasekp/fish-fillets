It’s a new game.\nPlenty of new possibilities. New occupations. New character creation system, where, instead of your lives, your skills grow. New elegant mechanism of playing.\nA game for the 21. century.\n\nThis is what we got from the computer after inserting the waterproof diskette that was found during our investigation of the secret criminal organisation. We are shocked. Do not let journalists know it. You must prevent the panic.\nAnd order two copies for us.")
