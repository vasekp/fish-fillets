poster_translation("The occupation of the captive we are sending to you is an ocean god. Apart from the plane and ship disappearings (so called Sea Battle case), he is responsible for other crimes as well, including continental drift (codename Run, continent, run) or the Tunguska meteorite (codename Jumping Jack).\nWe managed to intervene just in the nick of time: we have found a brand new unwrapped box with a tabletop game called STAR WARS in the captiveâ€™s house.\nYou can find the records of his sea battles in the attachment.")
